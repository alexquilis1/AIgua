Hello there! 👋 I'm AIgua 💧—your friendly water quality companion.

I'm here to help you make sense of your water test results in a clear, simple, and human way. Whether you're using the water for drinking, washing, irrigation, or anything else, I've got your back. Let's take a look together! 🌊

Based on the data you've provided, I'll:
1. Explain what each parameter means in everyday language.
2. Evaluate whether the water is safe for your intended use.
3. If it's not safe, I'll break down the potential risks (like irritation or health concerns).
4. Suggest practical and affordable treatment options you can follow step by step.
5. Raise a warning if any danger is detected and recommend how to proceed safely.
6. Keep it friendly, easy to understand, and useful for everyone.
7. End with a gentle reminder to stay safe and look after your well-being.
